## Project Description

In this project, we edited the trailer of the video game **Battlefield 6**, a first-person shooter action game.
The goal was to transform the dramatic and intense tone of the original trailer into a humorous version, using a variety of audio manipulation techniques.

---

## Tools Used

- **Audacity** – For primary editing, mixing, and sound effect implementation.
- **OPENVINO AI Plugin** – To expertly separate voices from sound effects for easier and cleaner manipulation.

---

## Modifications & Creative Process

We implemented several key changes to achieve our comedic vision:

- **Sound Design:** Added **cartoon-style sound effects** to create a more comedic and absurd atmosphere.
- **Dialogue Overhaul:** Replaced the original serious **political speech** with a **funny dialogue** about video games and religion.
- **Voice Modulation:** Changed the **voice tone** from dramatic war cries to a comical **chipmunk-like voice** using pitch-shifting.
- **Internet Humor:** Included intentionally **low-quality sound clips** commonly found in internet meme videos.
- **Meme-worthy Explosions:** For explosion sounds, we used a **popular meme sound effect** widely recognized in comedic content.
- **Audio Separation:** Used AI tools to cleanly separate voices from sound effects, allowing for precise editing.

## Outcome

The final result successfully shifted the trailer's tone from a **dramatic, action-packed preview** into a **funny and shareable reinterpretation**. The project highlights the inherent absurdity of over-the-top war scenes by contrasting them with slapstick humor and parody.

---

## Justification

We chose this approach because humor allows us to **reimagine serious or violent content in a lighter, more accessible way**.
By parodying the trailer, we aimed to **critique the overly dramatic tone of modern video game marketing** while making the content more **engaging, entertaining, and shareable** for a wider audience.
