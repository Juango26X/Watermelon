## Project Description
In this project, we edited the trailer of the video game **Battlefield 6**, a first-person shooter action game.  
The goal was to transform the dramatic and intense tone of the original trailer into a humorous version.

## Modifications
- Added **cartoon-style sound effects** to create a more comedic atmosphere.  
- Replaced the original **political speech** with a **funny dialogue** about video games and religion.  
- Changed the **voice tone** from war cries and dramatic shouts to a comical **chipmunk-like voice**.  
- Included **low-quality sound clips** commonly used in internet humor videos.  
- For explosions, we used a **popular meme sound effect** widely recognized in comedic content.  
- separate voices from sound effects.
## Outcome
The final result shifted the trailer from a **dramatic, action-packed preview** into a **funny reinterpretation**, highlighting the absurdity of war scenes by adding humor and parody.

## Tools Used
- **Audacity** – for editing and mixing.  
- **OPENVINO AI Plugin** – to separate voices and sound effects for easier manipulation

## justification.
We chose this approach because humor allows us to **reimagine serious or violent content in a lighter, more accessible way**.  
By parodying the trailer, we aimed to **critique the overly dramatic tone of modern video game marketing** while making the content more **engaging, entertaining, and shareable** for a wider audience.
